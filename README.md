# Influencer Impact and Marketing Sales Modeling and Analysis
 This project focuses on analyzing the impact of influencer marketing and promotional budgets (TV, Radio, Social Media) on sales using machine learning and statistical modeling techniques in Python. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and regression modeling (simple and multiple linear regression) to uncover patterns and relationships between marketing investments and sales performance. The goal is to provide actionable insights that can help businesses optimize their marketing strategies and  investments, enabling them to allocate resources effectively. The project leverages Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, statsmodels, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, modeling, and visualization.
